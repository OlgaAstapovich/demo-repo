If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that could save me,
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh,
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
Will keep you by my side,
Will keep you from walking out the door.

Chorus:]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight,
If I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby.
Just like the clouds,
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away,
Everyday, it will rain,
Rain, rain...

I'll never be your mother's favorite,
Your daddy can't even look me in the eyes.
Oooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing,
Saying, there goes my little girl,
Walking with that troublesome guy.

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand.
Oooh, well, little darling,
Watch me change their minds,
Yea, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try.
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding,
If that'll make you mine.
