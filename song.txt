If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that could save me,
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh,
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
Will keep you by my side,
Will keep you from walking out the door.
